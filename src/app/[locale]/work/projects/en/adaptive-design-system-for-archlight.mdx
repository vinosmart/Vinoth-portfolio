## Overview

In this project, I developed a flexible and scalable design system using Nuxt.js for front-end development and Figma for design collaboration. The goal was to create a reusable component library that not only adheres to consistent design principles but is also easily extendable for future needs. The design system aimed to improve the overall developer experience while maintaining visual consistency across multiple projects.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using Vue and Tailwind CSS in Nuxt.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens.
- **Figma Integration**: Collaborated closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring seamless design handoffs and consistent design tokens across platforms.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation using Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring easy adoption by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Nuxt.js**: For building fast, server-rendered Vue applications.
- **Vue.js**: The core JavaScript framework for building the UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS and responsive design.
- **REST API**: To integrate backend services.
- **Netlify and Vercel**: For deployment and hosting.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaborative development.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing flexibility with the need to maintain design consistency. The solution involved creating well-defined design tokens and clear guidelines for component customization. Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between designers and developers using Figma and GitHub improved the process significantly.

## Outcome
The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, resulting in faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It has become a foundation for scaling products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
